A Bayesian Multivariate Segmented Regression Analysis for Biomarker Detection in Rheumatoid Arthritis
=====================================================================================================

The repository contains codes, figures and tables that are used to in the research Detecting Change-Points in Preclinical Rheumatoid Arthritis Biomarkers Using Bayesian Multivariate Segmented Regression.

## Contents
### Figures folder
- contains all the figures generated by our analysis
### stan folder
- contains stan code (for both truncation and censored models)
### .R files 
contain various r-scripts related to data cleaning, modeling and figure/table generation including:
- censored-plots.R contains code to generate the posterior density plots and posterior summaries for censored model (both sample A and B biomarkers) 
- clean-data-new.R data cleaning for sample B
- clean-data.R: data cleaning for sample A
- mcmc-stan.R; all R codes that interface with stan to conduct MCMC sampling for all models
- plot-new-biomarkers.R; code to generate the loess plots of sample B biomakers
- plots.R; code to generate the loess plots of sample A biomakers
- sens-clean-data-new.R; data cleaning of sample B biomarkers for the sensibility analysis (reported in Supplement)
- sens-clean-data.R; data cleaning of sample A biomarkers for the sensibility analysis (reported in Supplement)
- tables.R; includes  code used to generate table1
- truncated-plots.R; contains code to generate the posterior density plots and posterior summaries for the truncated (main) model (both sample A and B biomarkers)
